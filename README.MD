# Problem Statement

iPrint, an Indian media house, provides diverse news and information services across sports, weather, health, stocks, and more. While iPrint has historically recommended popular and similar articles to users, this approach lacks personalization and fails to engage many users, resulting in declining user retention and revenue. To address this, iPrint aims to deliver a more personalized experience by recommending new, relevant articles to users each day and suggesting similar articles on individual news pages.

To meet these goals, iPrint seeks a robust recommendation system that will:

1.  Display the top 10 new relevant articles to users at the start of each day.
2. Recommend the top 10 similar articles when users click on any news item.

The recommendation system must avoid showing content previously viewed or removed from the platform, and only English-language articles will be used for content-based recommendations. The final output should provide the names and IDs of the recommended articles.
